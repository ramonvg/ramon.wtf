        My name is Ramon Villalonga GÃ³mez. I was born in Mallorca, Spain in 1993. I'm a Backend Developer and the maker of various products. I enjoy creating scalable and highly reliable systems. I try to follow the TDD principles. During my career I have gained in-depth experience with Python and PostgreSQL. I find the Agile methodologies necessary to get the best out of a team.

      Sling is a scheduling software. The team I was working was distributed in three continents. My responsibilities were various: creating new functionalities for the core product and optimizing them for a high number of RPM, releasing my own code and making sure it was working as expected. I created, released and maintained an analytics microservice successfully and also setup a CI platform to improve our build times. I also accomplished an upgrade of the database in a zero downtime fashion.

        trepar the climber's guide and social network. I built this platform on my own to improve my skills in all the scopes of app development. From DevOps and Backend to compile the Ionic app and publish it in the PlayStore. trepar is built on top of FastAPI deployed in Docker. The mobile app - which is a PWA aswell - is built using Ionic in it's Angular flavour. This project improved a lot my frontend skills.
