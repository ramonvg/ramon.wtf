      Sling is a scheduling software.

  The team I was working was distributed in three continents. My responsibilities were various: creating new functionalities for the core product and optimizing them for a lot of RPM, releasing my own code and making sure it was working as expected. I created, released and maintained an analytics microservice successfully and also setup a CI platform to improve our build times. I also accomplished an upgrade of the database in a zero downtime fashion.

  Hundredrooms is a vacation rental comparator.

  I was programming and maintaining multiple microservices written in Python using AIOHTTP. Most of them used MySQL and Redis. The development environment was working in Docker. Took care of managing the internationalization of the site.

  bttr is an agile retrospective tool.
  bttr is a platform I co-founded. I took care of the whole backend using AIOHTTP and SQLAlchemy. On the operations side I used Docker and Ansible to release the API on a Ubuntu VM. I also did some frontend with Ionic (Angular).
